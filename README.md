This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in bash scripting: inadequate error handling.  The `bug.sh` script attempts to process a file but fails to check for common errors like the file not existing or commands failing.  The `bugSolution.sh` script shows how to properly handle these errors using exit codes and conditional checks. This improved error handling prevents unexpected script termination and provides more informative error messages.
